# scrambler
Scrambler is the original Discord bot created for generating scrambles for twisty puzzles.

Scrambler was made to make getting twisty puzzle scrambles easier and more convenient than ever! If you spend any time on a Discord server talking to your cubing friends, Scrambler is a must-have with built-in competitions, dozens of scramble options, and customizable features to make it your own. The first Discord bot of its kind, Scrambler has been trusted by hundreds of cubing servers big and small for their online scramble needs.

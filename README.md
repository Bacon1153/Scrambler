# scrambler
> Scrambler is the original Discord bot created for generating scrambles for twisty puzzles. 

This bot was made to make getting twisty puzzle scrambles easier and more convenient than ever! If you spend any time on a Discord server talking to your cubing friends, Scrambler is a must-have with dozens of supported puzzles and relays so you can race one another to your heart's content. The first Discord bot of its kind, Scrambler has been trusted by thousands of cubing servers big and small for their community scramble needs (CubeHead, TheCubicle, SpeedCubeShop, and Cubeorithms to name a few).

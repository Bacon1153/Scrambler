# Multiple Scrambles

Right after the normal `s!puzzle` command, add any number. For example, to get 5 unique 3x3 scrambles, do `s!3x3 5` . Depending on the puzzle type, you may get less scrambles than requested due to Discord limiting messages to 2000 characters.

{% hint style="success" %}
Always replace `<puzzle>` with the actual puzzle you want scrambles for.
{% endhint %}

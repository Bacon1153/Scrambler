# Submitting times

## Submitting a time

When submitting a time, make sure to submit your average time of all 5 solves. This is the time that will be counted when determining results.

```
s!submit <event> <result>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 If you aren't sure how to spell an event name, do s!events.
{% endhint %}

If you made a mistake when submitting your time, you can submit again. Only your most recent time will be counted.

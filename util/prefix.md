# Setting a Prefix

{% hint style="info" %}
You need the Manage Server permission to use this command.
{% endhint %}

The default Scrambler prefix for all commands is `s!`.  To change this prefix, do the following command:

```text
s!prefix <desired prefix>
```

Change `<desired prefix>` to whatever character or string you want to set your prefix to. Scrambler will now respond to whatever prefix you set the same way it would to `s!`. 

### Resetting your Prefix

To reset your prefix, do the following command:

```text
s!prefix reset
```

After this command, your prefix will be `s!`.
